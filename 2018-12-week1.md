## 2018/11 week5 - 2018/12 week1

### Paper: [Joint Representation Learning of Cross-lingual Words and Entities via Attentive Distant Supervision][1]
- conference: EMNLP2018

### Paper: [Segment-Level Neural Conditional Random Fields for Named Entity Recognition][2]
- conference: IJCNLP2017
Combine (i) BiLSTM-CNN with thresholding (hyperparameter) construct segment lattice and (ii) linear-chain CRF estimate optimal tag sequence

### Misc: [Amazon Comprehend Medical â€“ Natural Language Processing for Healthcare Customers][3]
- Medical NLP application by Amazon

### Misc: [Stanford NLP is still alive!][4]
- `Stanford NER clearly outperformed the Edinburgh Geoparser, a rule-based system [for] historical documents, or the NER-Tagger software package, which leverages a more advanced statistical model`
